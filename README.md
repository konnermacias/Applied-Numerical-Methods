These are some of the coding type assignments I was given in my math class, and received full marks on every assignment.

For each .m file, I have indicated in the comments how to split up the code into separate .m files to run the program as a whole in MATLAB

1. Laguerre's and Horner's Method. Please reading the prompt in the pdf under "Coding Type Questions"

2. Building a natural spline. Please see the attached pdf for instructions

3. Code the Gaussian-elimination-Gauss-Jordan hybrid method using scaled partial pivoting during the Gaussian elimination stage.
